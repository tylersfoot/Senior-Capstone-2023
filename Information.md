# Environments / Enemies

## Towns

Towns are made of various materials of candy. Most of the towns in each area have structures resembling the environment they are found in. The capital of Candyland mostly features Jawbreakers as an impenetrable fortress setup.

## Candy Corn Fields

### Summary

The Candy Corn Fields surround much of the land that make up the commonfolk of the Candyland kingdom where inside they grow an abundance of candy deemed edible for the people of the Candy kingdom. Typically, there are only low level threats in these fields; however, those that work here know the dangers. With the emergence of a new force, there is even more to be afraid of, from mutated candy to the rotting of once great lands.

### Enemies

- Crazy-corn `[Single-bite]` - A candy corn that has been corrupted by an influx of sugar.

- Caramel Clops `[Multi-bite]` - Once great steeds used by farmers they now run loose stomping anything they find with their massive, sticky hooves.

- Pumpkin Spice Scarecrow - Was just waiting around protecting its crops when it went to go accomplish something with its life, began studying at a prestigious school, started a small business, but came back after they found out they couldn’t pay for wifi.

- Maple Pancake Bear - Largest creature laying with the forests of the fields. Laying in wait for one to come just close enough so that they may be devoured by its buttery goodness. Surviving on only the Bear necessities.

### Plant-Life

- Candy-Corn Stalk - A stalk of corn, but there is candy corn growing instead of corn.

- Candy-Apple Tree - Sweet apples covered in dripping caramel; A favorite of the Caramel-Clops

- Maple - Just a maple tree but instead of regular leaves they are jars of maple syrup

### Structures

- Farmhouse - A small farmhouse once used by the people that lived here, sadly they were kicked out, now who know what monstrosities live there

- Fields - Fields of Candy-corn growing randomly, once gently controlled plains are now overrun by the wildness that was allowed to run free

## Peppermint Forest

### Summary

The Peppermint Forest lies to the south of the Candy kingdom being the main source of hard materials for the use of buildings, walls, and other tools. The first feeling you get entering this land is a brisk breeze from the sheer amount of mint and a cooling feeling. On arrival you can see the vast forest lying between great mountains of frozen ice cream. In this land there is much to explore, but you must also be wary of the dangers that lie within. The creatures here have adapted to the harsh environment and are some of the most ferocious and resilient in candyland. Not only the animals, but the native people are especially aggressive towards outsiders resulting from multiple battles and geopolitical struggles between themselves and the Munchkin people.

### Enemies

- Peppercorn `[Multi-bite]` - A unicorn but peppermint

- Cane Stalker `[Multi-bite]` - Giant spider-like candy cane creature, seems to be a mutation from an influx of sugar.

- Minty Fowl `[Single-bite]` -  An extremely aggressive chicken like creature

- Sorbetiros `[Multi-bite]` -  The native people differentiated from the Munchkin people early on. They live solely on the Peppermint Forest’s resources and don’t take kindly to strangers. They are made of mint ice cream and offer a cool refreshing taste.

### Plant-Life

- Ever-canes - Candy-cane shaped trees that grow in these harsh conditions, in some areas they are tall, in some they are short, in some they are moving bu- nope thats just a Cane Stalker coming to bite your head off.

- Minty Bush - A bush made of mint leaves the typical place to find minty-fowl.


### Structures

- Caneyard - A massive building that contains a lot of canes used in construction

- Gelato Grotto - A cove built completely with ice cream that serves as a temporary base for some Sorbetiro lumberjacks

## Peanut Butter Swamp

### Summary

One of the most delicious, but dangerous, lands. The Peanut Butter Swamp has one thing that the rest of candyland does not, nuts. Many of the sentient inhabitants of Candyland have found themselves allergic to nuts, having an adverse effect to anything touching them. However within the swamp there are a plentiful amount of creatures that call it home and use it to their advantage.

### Enemies

- Peanut Butter Toad `[Multi-bite]` - Giant frog that inhabits the swamps

- Brittle Snake `[Multi-bite]` - An enormous snake made of tough peanut brittle. If anyone's allergic to peanuts you better watch out.

- Dark Mosquilate `[Single-bite]` - An intense aerialist insect that has a multi-view system and allows for the taking of nutrients from its pre--its a mosquito.

- Chocodile `[Multi-bite]` -  Lives in the swamps, waiting, waiting….probably just taking a nap.

### Plant-Life

- Dead Choco Tree - Once a thriving area of chocolate, this land has been sunken under an outrageous amount of peanut butter which has lead to the death of many a Choco Trees

- Peanut Brittle - Giant shards of Peanut Brittle that come forth from the ground, an adverse affect resulting from the solidification of the peanut butter inside clumps of chocolate

### Structures

## Gumdrop Valley

### Summary

the most typical depiction of candyland full of sweets, treats, and all manner of delectables for you to munch on. From the massive Gumdrop Hills to the crystal candy caverns this is one of the most stunning, and bright, lands. Most of the land was once inhabited by the people of the candyland.
### Enemies

# Game mechanics

## Consumption

### Summary

Plum is a ravenous girl, her appetite knows no bounds, especially for candy. This has carried on into the dreamlike candyland through the ability to eat literally anything and gain the powers of that object, enemy, or person.

### Power

Plum can eat any enemy and gain their attributes, such as eating a peanut butter swamp frog and gaining the ability to quickly maneuver throughout the peanut butter swamp. When Plum eats any other things this power is replaced and therefore given up for the next power. (If we decide to have it so Plum has an inventory maybe we can make so that defeated enemies drop chunks of their candy and allow Plum to eat those to gain the powers on the go).

### Environment and Aesthetics

With this being added in every time Plum transforms we can change her sprite to resemble that of what she had just eaten. Again with the peanut butter swamp frog we can have her dress transform into a brownish color and maybe give her hands a more glossy look. I was also thinking of adding in that he can eat portions of the environment, a fully edible environment if you will.

## Weapons

### Summary

Plum needs to battle a lot on her journey so weapons are a must. While Plum does have the consumption ability this should not do enough damage in the beginning to allow her to one-shot eat anything. On her journeys I think Plum should either be able to obtain weapons through completing quests or have the option to build her own weapons. If we have it so she builds her own weapons we will have to add in a  whole crafting system, with resource gathering and the like, however it would go along with our whole livable environment feel. If we go with the quest based weapon obtaining it will be easier but we have to find another way for Plum to get more ammo for any non-melee weapons, example like she has to kill a certain enemy type or maybe she sells the enemy parts and then buys more ammo.

### Bubblegum Blaster

Does minimal damage; dispenses colorful gumballs to help defend against enemies.

- Obtained at the start of the game

### Candy Cane Stake Launcher

Fires sharpened candy canes that pierce through enemies and can hit those behind them. This deals a lot of damage, but doesn't hold a lot of ammo.

- Crafted using `15 chicken parts` + `3 camel parts`

### Peanut Brittle Blaster

Fires peanut butter shards in bursts that poison enemies.

- Crafted with `20 mosquito parts` + `5 frog parts`

## Sugar Rush

### Summary

Plum is a small girl eating a massive amount of candy on a daily basis. The amount of sugar sometimes is just to much for her to handle, in these cases the sugar is released in a frenzy of power wherein Plum can eat almost anything followed by a short nap afterwards.

### Power

Plum will have a constant sugar meter that fills up throughout the game after every time she eats something. When the sugar meter gets high enough she will enter Sugar Rush form and be able to use weapons quickly, be resilient to damage, and eat almost anything. In this form had she eaten anything prior and had the powers of that thing we maybe should add in an almost evolved form of whatever she had eaten and make it gigantic and cool.

### Environment and Aesthetics

The vision of the player will be turned into sugar rush mode where every thing gets a little pinker and hearts and bubbles start flying across the screen.
