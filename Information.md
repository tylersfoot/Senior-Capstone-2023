# Environments / Enemies

## Towns

Towns will be made of various materials of candy, if there is a town in each area they may have structures resembling that of the environment they are found in. The capital of Candyland will feature mostly Jawbreakers as an impenetrable fortress setup.

## Candy Corn Fields

### Summary

The Candycorn fields surround much of the land that make up the commonfolk of the Candyland kingdom whereinside they grow an abundance of candy deemed edible for the people of the Candy kingdom. Typically there are only low level threats in these fields however those that work in them know their dangers. With the mergence of a knew force however there is even more to be afraid of from mutated candy to the rotting of once great lands.

## Consumption

### Summary

Plum is a ravenous girl, her appetite know’s no bounds, especially for candy. This has carried on into the dreamlike candyland through the ability to eat literary anything and gain the powers of that object, enemy, or person.

### Power

Plum can eat any enemy and gain their attributes, such as eating a peanut butter swamp frog and gaining the ability to quickly maneuver throughout the peanut butter swamp. When Plum eats any other things this power is replaced and therefor given up for the next power. (If we decide to have it so Plum has an inventory maybe we can make so that defeated enemies drop chunks of their candy and allow Plum to eat those to gain the powers on the go).

### Environment and Aesthitics

With this being added in every time Plum transforms we can change her sprite to resemble thatof what she had just eaten. Again with the peanut butter swamp frog we cna have her dress transform into a brownish colo nd maybe give her hands a more glossy look. I  was also thinking of adding in that he can eat portions of the environment, a fully edible environment if you will.

## Weapons

### Summary

Plum needs to battle a lot on her journey so weapons are a must. While Plum does have the consumption ability this should not do enough damag ein the beginning to allow her to c\just one-shot eat anything. On her journeys I think Plum should either be able to obtain weapons through completing quests or have the option to build her opwn weapons. If we have it so she builds her own weaposn we will have to add in a  whole crafting system, with resource gathering and the like, however it would go along with our whole livable environment feel. If we go with the quest based weapon obtaining it will be easier but we have to find another way for Plum to get more ammo for any non-melee weapons, example like she has to kill a certain enemy type or maybe she sells the enemy parts and then buys more ammo.

### Bubble-Gum Blaster

This does no damage, it only allows for the slowing down of enemies through the use of bubble gum balls that will spread across the gorudn and slow anything that walks into them.

### Candy Cane Stake Launcher

Fires sharpened candy canes theat pierce through enemies and can hit those behind them. This deals a lot of damage however it doens’t hold a lot of ammo.

### Peanut Brittle Shard Shooter

This weapon will fire peanut butter shards which are posionous to most candy enemies found thorughout candy-land save for those residents fo the PEanut Butter swamp. Not only doe shtis poison enemies it also allows for them to form giant bulbous protrusions that maybe we can make have more damage delta to them.

## Sugar Rush

### Summary

Plum is a small girl eating a massive amount of candy on a daily basis. The amount of sugar sometimes is just to much for her to handle, in these cases the sugar is released in a frenzy of power wherein Plum can eat almost anythingfollowed by a short nap afterwards.

### Power

Plum will have a constant sugar meter that fills up throughout the game after everytime she eats something. When the sugar meter gets high enough she will enter Sugar Rush form and be able to use weapons quickly, be resilient to damge, and eat almost anyhting. In this form ahd she eaten anything prior and had the powers of that thing we maybe should add in an almost evolved form of whatever she had eaten and make it gigantic and cool.

### Environment and Aesthetics

The vision of the player will be turned into sugar rush mode where every thign gets a little pinker and hearts and bubbles start flying across the screen.
