# Environments / Enemies

## Towns

Towns are made of various materials of candy. Most of the towns in each area have structures resembling the environment they are found in. The capital of Candyland mostly features Jawbreakers as an impenetrable fortress setup.

## Candy Corn Fields

### Summary

The Candy Corn Fields surround much of the land that make up the commonfolk of the Candyland kingdom where inside they grow an abundance of candy deemed edible for the people of the Candy kingdom. Typically, there are only low level threats in these fields; however, those that work here know the dangers. With the emergence of a new force, there is even more to be afraid of, from mutated candy to the rotting of once great lands.

## Consumption

### Summary

Plum is a ravenous girl, her appetite knows no bounds, especially for candy. This has carried on into the dreamlike candyland through the ability to eat literary anything and gain the powers of that object, enemy, or person.

### Power

Plum can eat any enemy and gain their attributes, such as eating a peanut butter swamp frog and gaining the ability to quickly maneuver throughout the peanut butter swamp. When Plum eats any other things this power is replaced and therefore given up for the next power. (If we decide to have it so Plum has an inventory maybe we can make so that defeated enemies drop chunks of their candy and allow Plum to eat those to gain the powers on the go).

### Environment and Aesthetics

With this being added in every time Plum transforms we can change her sprite to resemble that of what she had just eaten. Again with the peanut butter swamp frog we can have her dress transform into a brownish color and maybe give her hands a more glossy look. I was also thinking of adding in that he can eat portions of the environment, a fully edible environment if you will.

## Weapons

### Summary

Plum needs to battle a lot on her journey so weapons are a must. While Plum does have the consumption ability this should not do enough damage in the beginning to allow her to one-shot eat anything. On her journeys I think Plum should either be able to obtain weapons through completing quests or have the option to build her own weapons. If we have it so she builds her own weapons we will have to add in a  whole crafting system, with resource gathering and the like, however it would go along with our whole livable environment feel. If we go with the quest based weapon obtaining it will be easier but we have to find another way for Plum to get more ammo for any non-melee weapons, example like she has to kill a certain enemy type or maybe she sells the enemy parts and then buys more ammo.

### Bubble-Gum Blaster

This does no damage, it only allows for the slowing down of enemies through the use of bubble gum balls that will spread across the ground and slow anything that walks into them.

### Candy Cane Stake Launcher

Fires sharpened candy canes that pierce through enemies and can hit those behind them. This deals a lot of damage however it doesn't hold a lot of ammo.

### Peanut Brittle Shard Shooter

This weapon will fire peanut butter shards which are poisonous to most candy enemies found throughout Candyland save for those residents of the Peanut Butter Swamp. Not only does this poison enemies it also allows for them to form giant bulbous protrusions that maybe we can make have more damage dealt to them.

## Sugar Rush

### Summary

Plum is a small girl eating a massive amount of candy on a daily basis. The amount of sugar sometimes is just to much for her to handle, in these cases the sugar is released in a frenzy of power wherein Plum can eat almost anything followed by a short nap afterwards.

### Power

Plum will have a constant sugar meter that fills up throughout the game after every time she eats something. When the sugar meter gets high enough she will enter Sugar Rush form and be able to use weapons quickly, be resilient to damage, and eat almost anything. In this form had she eaten anything prior and had the powers of that thing we maybe should add in an almost evolved form of whatever she had eaten and make it gigantic and cool.

### Environment and Aesthetics

The vision of the player will be turned into sugar rush mode where every thing gets a little pinker and hearts and bubbles start flying across the screen.
